# Movie List App

A simple movie list app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add their favorite movies to the list and delete them as needed. The app features a responsive design, hover effects, and a clean user interface. This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

# Events:

## 1. click Event
The click event is used to handle mouse clicks on an element. In the code, it is used to delete a movie from the list when the delete button is clicked.

## 2. submit Event
The submit event is used to handle form submissions. In the code, it is used to add a new movie to the list when the "Add to list" button is clicked.

## 3. DOMContentLoaded Event
The DOMContentLoaded event is used to execute a function when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed. In the code, it is used to add event listeners to the movie list and the add movie form.
